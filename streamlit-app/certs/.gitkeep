# Place your mTLS and JWT signing certificates in this folder:
#
# For mTLS (CommonWell API calls):
# - client.crt (Client certificate in PEM format)
# - client.key (Client private key in PEM format)
# - ca.crt (CA certificate in PEM format, optional)
#
# For JWT Signing (CommonWell JWT generation):
# - certificate.pem (X.509 certificate for x5t header)
# - private_key.pem (RSA private key for RS384 signing)
#
# Note: In non-production, the same certificate is typically used for both mTLS and JWT signing.
#
# These files should NOT be committed to version control.
